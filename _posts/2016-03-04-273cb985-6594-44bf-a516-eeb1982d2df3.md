Koi Chi Healing

The koi are legendary fish in Chinese and Japanese culture, ancient to this earth they have existed for 20 million years and are iconic to the process of transformation.

Legend tells that a school of golden koi were swimming upstream in the Yellow River in China, they fought through the current with great strength and shimmered in gold as they swam. At the end of the river is a waterfall and many turned around when faced with this obstacle. Some stayed to make this leap and through perseverance and determination, and for a 100 years they never gave up despite the demons that tried to intervene. Then one koi fish finally reached the top of the waterfall and transformed into a golden dragon, a symbol of power and strength, fulfilling its destiny.

Through Koi Chi Healing, you will transform from koi to dragon.
